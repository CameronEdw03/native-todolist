# Todo List - My First React Native App

This is a simple **Todo List** mobile app built with **React Native**. I created this app to practice and learn React Native fundamentals, and to track my learning progress with hands-on experience.

## Features

- Add new tasks via the input box
- Press Enter to add a task (no button needed)
- Display a list of tasks with checkboxes
- Toggle tasks as completed or incomplete by tapping the checkbox
- Completed tasks show with strikethrough styling
- Simple, clean, and responsive UI

## Why I Built This

As someone familiar with React JS, I wanted to dive into **React Native** by building a practical app that helps me:

- Understand React Native components and styling
- Practice state management with hooks (`useState`)
- Work with native inputs and lists (`TextInput` and `FlatList`)
- Manage touch interactions (`Pressable` and toggling state)
- Learn to structure a small project and handle user input
